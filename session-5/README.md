# Unity and Cake

# Session 5: We did it!

Oh my God, we totally made a game! We're probably not quite ready to become a App Store/Steam millionaires yet, but we've learned the basics of creating games with Unity and gained the knowledge, confidence and momentum to keep learning on our own.

## The Unity Editor

### Building a game

Up to date instructions on building a Unity game can be found on [this page of the Unity Manual](http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PublishingBuilds.html).

## What’s next?

### Tutorials

To reinforce what we’ve been over and learn some new tricks, I recommend following some more tutorials. [Unity's tutorials](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials) are great - Survival Shooter and Tanks are particularly good for beginners.

### More Make Play Code

Follow us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/makeplaycode/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/makeplaycode) to hear about more courses, social events, opportunities for volunteering, etc.

## Resources

Here’s a bunch of things I’ve wanted to share throughout the course but not really known where to put - stuff that I’ve found useful or inspiring as I’ve learned. Dip in and enjoy!

The [#unitytips hashtag on Twitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/unitytips) - Every Tuesday, people tweet handy Unity tips. Some useful, some, uh, less useful. Worth a read!

[A Reading List For Game Developers](http://v21.io/blog/a-reading-list-for-game-developers/) - A list by my friend George Buckenham. Inspiration and education of all kinds.

[Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0735611319?keywords=code&qid=1439725378) - This book is EXCELLENT at explaining how a computer works, and what happens between your code and the actual hardware. Accessible to anyone with a bit of programming knowledge and a curiosity about what’s really happening inside the magic box. Genuinely cool stuff.

[CodeBar Brighton](http://codebar.io/brighton) - Friendly local group for women and other underrepresented minorities in tech where you can learn to code for free. They don’t specialise in Unity but you can definitely brush up your JavaScript or C# there! And make new friends and eat pizza. They meet every Tuesday.

[Brighton Indies](http://brightonindies.com/) - Friendly pub meet for people who make games in Brighton, run by Kerry and her friend Eddy. Swing by some time if you want to talk shop, show what you’re working on, ask advice or just have a drink with some nice games-y people.
