# Unity and Cake

# Session 5: We did it!

Oh my God, we totally made a game! We've learned the basics of creating games with Unity and gained the knowledge, confidence and momentum to keep learning on our own.

## The Unity Editor

### Building a game

Up to date instructions on building a Unity game can be found on [this page of the Unity Manual](http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PublishingBuilds.html).

## What’s next?

### Tutorials

To reinforce what we've been over and learn some new tricks, I recommend following some more tutorials.

* [Unity's tutorials](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials) are great for learning more advanced scripting and features of the Unity environment - Survival Shooter and Tanks are particularly good for advanced beginners. 

* [KO-OP MODE's Make Weird Stuff in Unity](http://workshops.ko-opmode.com/) tutorial focuses on creativity and importing your own art into Unity. It doesn't involve any scripting and is very beginner-friendly.

### More Make Play Code

## Resources

Here’s a bunch of things I’ve wanted to share throughout the course but not really known where to put - stuff that I’ve found useful or inspiring as I’ve learned. Dip in and enjoy!

* [itch.io](http://itch.io/) - A site where people share and sell indie games.

* The [#unitytips hashtag on Twitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/unitytips) - Every Tuesday, people tweet handy Unity tips. Some useful, some, uh, less useful. Worth a read!

* [CodeBar Brighton](http://codebar.io/brighton) - Learn to code in this local group for women and other underrepresented minorities in tech. Brush up your C#, make new friends and eat pizza. They meet every Tuesday.

* [Brighton Indies](http://brightonindies.com/) - Friendly pub meet for people who make games in Brighton, run by Kerry and her friend Eddy. Swing by some time if you want to talk shop, show what you’re working on, ask advice or just have a drink with some nice games-y people.
