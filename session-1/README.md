# Unity and Cake

# Session 1: Starting from Scratch

## What we learned this week

This week we learned that a game is made of assets - such as graphic and sound files - and code. The code controls the game.

We learned that we can use Scratch to create code. We also learned that there is no shame at all in learning from resources aimed at children.

## This week’s homework

* Read through these notes.

* Finish your Scratch project! Make it as complex or simple as you like - just get used to the idea of using the code to control what happens. There are helpful links in the Resources section on how to use all the different blocks, and so on.

* When you’ve finished your project, please share it (instructions [here](http://wiki.scratch.mit.edu/wiki/Project_Sharing)) and send the link to [hello@makeplaycode.com](mailto:hello@makeplaycode.com).

## Coding basics

We learned that code can be broken down into two main types: data and instructions. The technical names that we’ll be using from now on are **_variables_** for data and **_functions_** for instructions. 

### Variables

Variables are pieces of information that we want to remember and use later. A variable has a name and a value. A real world example of a variable is a contact in your phone - it has a name (the person’s name) and a value (the person’s phone number).

In the sample project, there is a variable with a name of *candlesNeeded*. This variable is used to determine how many candles the player needs to collect to complete the game.

### Functions

A function is a set of instructions that is followed in order. When the program is told to follow that particular set of instructions, we say that the function has been **_called_**.

We’ll look at functions in more detail next week, but we can think of the connected blocks in Scratch as being like functions. When we send a message in Scratch, this is a way of calling these functions.

### Conditionals

Code can perform checks to decide which instructions to follow at a given time. These checks are called **_conditionals_**. 

A conditional consists of a **_statement_** such as "candlesNeeded is less than 1" and a set of instructions to follow if that statement is true. We can also, optionally, add other instructions to follow if the statement is false.

In the sample project, we use a conditional to send a message when the value of the variable named *candlesNeeded* was less than 1.

### Operators

**_Operators_** are symbols that represent mathematical or logical actions. Some are already familiar from everyday use and some are specific to programming. 

We looked at three types of operators today:

* *Arithmetic operators* describe an action that should be performed on two values, such as using + to add two number together.

* *Comparison operators* are used to compare two values, such as using > to determine if one number is greater than another.

* *Logical operators* are used to make conditionals more complex and powerful, such as using AND to indicate that something should happen if more than one statement is true.

In the sample project, we used an arithmetic operator to set the value of *candlesNeeded* to 3 when the game started and to reduce the value of *candlesNeeded* by 1 when the player clicked on candles. We used a comparison operator to check whether the value of *candlesNeeded* was 0, meaning that the player had collected all of the candles.
